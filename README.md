## About

The Citizen Intelligence Hackathon is a competition to create innovative ways to interpret and visualize the data made available in [Transparent Ceará](https://www.cge.ce.gov.br/hackathon/), through prototype technological solutions based on digital interfaces (software, websites, apps, chatbots, etc), which translate and facilitate their use and open access.

The goal is to foster, bring improvements to the transparency of the state, produce useful, reliable, and accessible information to citizens, through innovative solutions from society itself.

With this goal, the game [Citizen Intelligence Hackathon](https://github.com/lucapwn/hackathon) was created.

## The Game

In order not to deviate from the model of government websites, this game was developed based on the official website of this hackathon contest proposal, available [here](https://www.cge.ce.gov.br/hackathon/).

The game has a score ranking and three levels of difficulty, being them: ```easy```, ```medium```, and ```hard```.

According to the difficulty level, more questions will be proposed to the player.

In addition, the game has some sound effects.
